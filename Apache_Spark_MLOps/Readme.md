# SparkML Ops: Analyzing Search Terms and Predicting Sales for 2023

In this lab, we utilize Apache Spark to analyze search terms data from an e-commerce web server and predict sales for the year 2023 using a pretrained sales forecast model.

## Setup Instructions

### Installing Dependencies

1. Install PySpark and FindSpark:
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark
   pip install findspark
   ```

### Starting Spark Session

```python
import findspark
findspark.init()
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('Spark_MLOps').getOrCreate()
```

### Downloading and Loading Search Terms Data

1. Download the search terms dataset:
   ```python
   import requests

   url = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0321EN-SkillsNetwork/Bigdata%20and%20Spark/searchterms.csv"
   response = requests.get(url)

   local_filename = "searchterms.csv"
   with open(local_filename, 'wb') as file:
       file.write(response.content)
   ```

2. Load the dataset into a Spark DataFrame:
   ```python
   df = spark.read.csv('searchterms.csv', inferSchema=True, header=True)
   ```

### Analyzing Search Terms Data

1. Print the number of rows and columns:
   ```python
   df_count = df.count()
   df_columns = len(df.columns)
   print(f"Number of rows: {df_count}, Number of columns: {df_columns}")
   ```

2. Print the top 5 rows:
   ```python
   df.show(5)
   ```

3. Find the number of times the term 'gaming laptop' was searched:
   ```python
   df.createOrReplaceTempView('searches')
   spark.sql('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM searches WHERE searchterm="gaming laptop"').show()
   ```

4. Print the top 5 most frequently used search terms:
   ```python
   spark.sql('SELECT COUNT(*), searchterm FROM searches GROUP BY searchterm ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 5').show()
   ```

### Loading and Using the Sales Forecast Model

1. Download and extract the pretrained sales forecast model:
   ```bash
   !wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DB0321EN-SkillsNetwork/Bigdata%20and%20Spark/model.tar.gz
   !tar -xvzf model.tar.gz
   ```

2. Load the sales forecast model:
   ```python
   from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegressionModel

   model = LinearRegressionModel.load('sales_prediction.model')
   ```

### Predicting Sales for 2023

1. Define a function to predict sales for the year 2023 using the loaded model:
   ```python
   from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

   def predict_sales(year):
       assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['year'], outputCol='features')
       data = [[year, 0]]
       columns = ['year', 'sales']
       df_sales = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)
       df_assembled = assembler.transform(df_sales).select('features', 'sales')
       predictions = model.transform(df_assembled)
       predictions.select('prediction').show()

   # Predict sales for the year 2023
   predict_sales(2023)
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured correctly before running the scripts.
- Adjust file paths and commands as necessary based on your environment.
- Monitor Spark logs and outputs to troubleshoot any issues during execution.

This lab demonstrates using Spark for data analysis and leveraging a pretrained model for sales forecasting, showcasing the capabilities of SparkML Ops in handling big data tasks.
